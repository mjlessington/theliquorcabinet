# The Liquor Cabinet

## About
The Liquor Cabinet is a practical way to digitize your spirits inventory as well as help your friends build theirs. Users will have the ability to create a shareable wishlist of spirits not in their inventory. The ability to share wishlists also is a way to optimze adult gift-giving while taking away the guessing aspect when wondering what spirits a person wants or will enjoy. Also built in the app is the ability to search nearby stores for available spirits.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, Node.js, EJS, Express, Mongodb, Mongoose and various components of all were used. Bootstrap was the primary source of CSS. 

## Future Developments
1. The ability to create a wishlist that can be shared with other users. Users will also be able to search for another user's wishlist via username. 
2. Development of a mobile app 
3. Connect to an API that can help locate where products can be purchased near the user. Also connect to an API that allows a user get cocktail recipes by entering a few ingredients.
4. On a more technical level, making the app secure with the use of sessions and implementing bcrypt. 

## Roadblocks/Challenges
1. While Bootstrap is a very valuable tool, CSS is not my friend. The TA provided a very helpful resource that provided clarity with targeting parent and child elements in code. 
2. Over-engineering. The most resonating statement when I sought help for one problem was this: "Mell, you doing too much." Such liberating word!
3. There's still some CSS that I'm working to figure out as it pertains to mobile devices. While Bootstrap is a wonderful tool, it's not all encompassing or perfect.
