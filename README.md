# The Liquor Cabinet

## About
In March of 2020, to a generation of medically advanced and tech-savvy humans, shook the world in a way unimaginable. A novel coronavirus, COVID-19, gave us no choice but to pause life the way we knew it and enter into a quarantine that forced us to do what most complain about not getting the chance to do enough: STAY HOME! Well, staying home and no bars led to a robust effort to stock and keep stocked my personal booze supply. Only thing is, keeping up with the inventory in my head made for a lot of guessing when at the Package Store. The Liquor Cabinet was developed as a practical way to keep up with that inventory as well as help your friends build theirs too with the sharing of wishlists. Besides, a healthy booze supply is what responsible adults do, right? RIGHT! Thanks for checking out The Liquor Cabinet!

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript/JQuery, Node.js, EJS, Express, Mongodb, Mongoose and various components of all were used. Bootstrap was the primary source of CSS. 

## Future Developments
1. The ability to create a wishlist that can be shared with other users. Users will also be able to search for another user's wishlist via username. 
2. Development of a mobile app 
3. Connect to an API that can help locate where products can be purchased near the user. Also connect to an API that allows a user get cocktail recipes by entering a few ingredients.
4. On a more technical level, making the app secure with the use of sessions and implementing bcrypt. 

## Roadblocks/Challenges
1. While Bootstrap is a very valuable tool, CSS is not my friend. The TA provided a very helpful resource that provided clarity with targeting parent and child elements in code. 
2. Over-engineering. The most resonating statement when I sought help for one problem was this: "Mell, you doing too much." Such liberating word!
3. There's still some CSS that I'm working to figure out as it pertains to mobile devices. While Bootstrap is a wonderful tool, it's not all encompassing or perfect.
